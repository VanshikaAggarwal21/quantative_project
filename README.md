# Market By Order (MBO) to Market By Price (MBP) Converter

A high-performance C++ implementation for converting Market By Order (MBO) data to Market By Price (MBP) format with real-time order book management and efficient price level aggregation.

## 🚀 Features

- *High Performance*: Processes 74,000+ records per second
- *Real-time Order Book*: Maintains live bid/ask levels with efficient price management
- *Top 10 Price Levels*: Generates MBP snapshots with top 10 bid and ask levels
- *Robust Error Handling*: Comprehensive error handling and validation
- *Memory Efficient*: Optimized data structures and buffered I/O
- *ISO 8601 Timestamps*: Preserves exact timestamp precision
- *Professional Code Quality*: Clean, well-documented C++17 implementation

## 📊 What it Does

This converter transforms individual order events (MBO) into aggregated price level snapshots (MBP):

- *Input*: Market By Order (MBO) records with individual order events
- *Output*: Market By Price (MBP) records with aggregated price levels
- *Processing*: Real-time order book updates with change tracking
- *Format*: CSV output with comprehensive market depth information

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- *MBOProcessor*: Main orchestrator for MBO to MBP conversion
- *OrderBook*: Efficient order book management with price level tracking
- *MBORecord*: Parses and validates MBO input records
- *MBPRecord*: Generates MBP output with price level aggregation
- *PriceLevel*: Manages orders at specific price points

### Data Flow


MBO Input → Parse Records → Update Order Book → Generate MBP → Output CSV


## 🛠️ Build & Installation

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, or MSVC 2017+)
- Make build system
- 4GB+ RAM recommended for large datasets

### Build Instructions

bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd quant_dev_trial

# Build the project
make clean && make

# Run with sample data
make run

# Validate output
make validate


### Build Commands

- make clean - Clean build artifacts
- make - Build the project
- make run - Run with sample data
- make validate - Validate output against expected results

## 📖 Usage

### Command Line Interface

bash
# Basic usage
./build/reconstruction_vanshika input_mbo.csv output_mbp.csv

# With default output file
./build/reconstruction_vanshika data/mbo.csv

# Example
./build/reconstruction_vanshika data/mbo.csv data/output/mbp_output.csv


### Input Format (MBO)

CSV file with the following columns:
- ts_recv, ts_event - ISO 8601 timestamps
- rtype, publisher_id, instrument_id - Market data identifiers
- action - Order action (A=Add, C=Cancel, F=Fill, R=Reset, T=Trade)
- side - Order side (B=Bid, A=Ask)
- depth, price, size - Order details
- flags, ts_in_delta, sequence - Additional metadata
- symbol, order_id - Order identification

### Output Format (MBP)

CSV file with aggregated price levels:
- Index column for record numbering
- Original MBO fields preserved
- Top 10 bid levels: bid_px_00 to bid_px_09, bid_sz_00 to bid_sz_09, bid_ct_00 to bid_ct_09
- Top 10 ask levels: ask_px_00 to ask_px_09, ask_sz_00 to ask_sz_09, ask_ct_00 to ask_ct_09

## ⚡ Performance

### Benchmarks

- *Processing Rate*: 74,506 records/second
- *Memory Usage*: Optimized for large datasets
- *Output Generation*: 5,825 MBP records from 5,886 MBO records
- *Processing Time*: ~80ms for sample dataset

### Optimizations

- *Buffered I/O*: 64KB output buffer for efficient file writing
- *Change Tracking*: Only generates MBP records when order book changes
- *Efficient Data Structures*: std::map for price levels, std::unordered_map for order lookups
- *Fast Parsing*: Optimized CSV parsing with minimal allocations

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Order Book Management

- *Price Level Aggregation*: Automatically aggregates orders at same price
- *Bid/Ask Separation*: Maintains separate bid and ask order books
- *Change Detection*: Tracks order book changes to optimize output generation
- *Reset Handling*: Properly handles market reset events

### Data Types

- *Price*: int64_t with 1e9 scaling for precision
- *Size*: uint64_t for order quantities
- *Timestamp*: std::string preserving ISO 8601 format
- *OrderID*: uint64_t for unique order identification

### Error Handling

- *Input Validation*: Validates CSV format and data types
- *Error Recovery*: Continues processing on individual record errors
- *Resource Management*: Proper cleanup of file handles and memory
- *Performance Monitoring*: Built-in performance tracking and reporting
